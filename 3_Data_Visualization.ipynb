After couple of minutes I figured everything out by myself and I added the BSC network to my MetaMask. The MetaMask system accepted the change of the network and the address were I sent my coin is the same. But this crap of wallet is not able to recognize that!! Meanwhile I lost the tokens that I â\\x80\\x9ctransferredâ\\x80\\x9d to my MetaMask wallet and still waiting for their crappy technical support to get in contact with me. If you watch videos about MetaMask in you tube, THEYâ\\x80\\x99RE NOT ADAPTED FOR a mobile IOS system. Also, MetaMask in IOS is built exclusively for the etherium network, meaning TOO high transaction fees!! My advice is that if you just depend on a IOS cellphone to invest in crypto Trust Wallet is the better option.

The representative looked at my account, pointed out the incoming and outgoing money, which I already seen in transaction history. Half hour chat to just tell me what I already knew. But when we concluded that someone fraudulently took my money out of my MetaMask account, she told me there is nothing she could do. I asked where to report it and if there was any additional steps I could take, and she ended the chat without even answering me. I will never use MetaMask ever again if not resolved. Your money is not safe! I only used it once before this, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m very cautious and conservative with any and all of my information. I used their transfer service called WYRE, that they obviously trust. And it shows the money entered my account at say 10:01, and was sent to another hackerâ\\x80\\x99s account at 10:02 without my permission or knowledge.

Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been taken over by other apps like ViaWallet, OKX and many others! I hate using any of the old CEX/DEX making me lose eth in the name of useless gas fee! What a boring idea to peg every swap with mountainous gas fee! Trust wallet, Coinbase, Binance, FTX and many more are designed to fail! The future doesnâ\\x80\\x99t belong to them! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s my observation! I swap between any crypto on ViaWallet or OKX without hearing anything called Gwei or gas fee! Ask urself, why? Why must I initiate transaction with high cost & it stays on pending and often canâ\\x80\\x99t be found on the Eth blockchain? These exchanges made it so for greed & greed only!

Even if you are not into yeild farming / liquidity mining, the app has an absolutely beautiful interface to use as a ether wallet (or any ERC-20 token for that matter... it supports them ALL) and is the best tool to access any web3 / DeFi system, period. The wallet creation process is very streamlined and informative so new users know the implications of *being responsible for keeping a paper backup (no screenshots people... your photo gallery is not secure) of your recovery phrase*. In crypto, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t own the keys, you donâ\\x80\\x99t own the crypto. So if all of yours assets are on some centralized exchange, say, Binance, then they own it, they control the keys, not you. So if Binance gets hacked, determines that you have violated their terms of use, an executive exit-scams, or their US branch gets shut down by the SEC or FED, your funds are gone. \\n\\nDeFi solves this entirely; if you can trust yourself to just keep several paper backups of your twelve word recovery phase in safe places, you can free yourself and your assets from the corrupt global centralized finance conglomerates. As a software architect myself, unaffiliated with MetaMask, I give hats off and a huge round of applause to the developers. \\n\\nAnd Apple, thank you so much for allowing this, and if you ever ban it, I will boycott you! The world is in dire need, now more than ever, of a new financial system to free them from corrupt, profiteering central banks who print money arbitrarily any time they face a problem. Decentralized Finance is that solution, and inhibiting itâ\\x80\\x99s inevitable success would be a literal crime against humanity. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and convert your USD to BTC and ETH, even if you donâ\\x80\\x99t use MetaMask. The run away inflation is coming with the BRR of the money printers, and keeping your money in the bank will lead to massive losses, whereas crypto is entering a bull market that will likely see global shifts away from centralized bloodsucking finance systems and in to Decentralized, Open Source, community-governed systems that compete freely to benefit the user, not the corporations.', 'Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been using this app for a few days now and itâ\\x80\\x99s great.

I buy my coins on there and transfer to this app. If you have a lot of coins, get a hardware wallet like ledger to put larger amounts. This wallet is good for accounts under 20k, think of the wallet like a checking out.\\n\\nEither way, so far, no problems. Make sure when making transactions you are using the correct things.

If the wrong recovery phrase is utilized it will let you know the phrase is incorrect and will not open anything. I have all my transaction records, as well as my wallet recovery key and wallet address written down together but now the wallet address does not match the recovery key. That is not a key issue but a issue within the trust wallet system which they do not know how to fix and would rather blame it on the recovery password.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had two different coins in my wallet for months now. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried converting them, exchanging them, staking them, and even just moving them from the wallet to Coinbase exchange. I can do none of the options I just mentioned. Moving coin from Coinbase to the wallet was as simple as you can imagine. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t even cost me a fee. That is absolutely not the way it works going the other direction. Try to move coin into coinbase exchange and youâ\\x80\\x99ll get the same exact thing you get trying to stake it or convert it. The miner fees are too high and you simply canâ\\x80\\x99t afford it. So, it just sits there. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s worse is, I tried to use their Dex browser to exchange, the exchange they recommended (matcha or something) took my ETH as a fee like it was going to exchange my coin, then literally did not make the exchange and told me I needed to deposit more ETH if I wanted to make a swap. Ultimately the exchange took at least $100 of ETH from me as a fee without even swapping. Somehow it ended up leaving me literally with $2 worth of ETH and $8 worth of LEASH. I know for a fact I had $150 worth of ETH and $100 worth of LEASH. Now, the balances are so low I canâ\\x80\\x99t do anything with the weak amounts that are left in the wallet. The wallet doesnâ\\x80\\x99t support LEASH and the ETH isnâ\\x80\\x99t enough to cover even the most minute transaction. All it does is ask me to deposit more ETH while also disclosing that they are not responsible for miner fees. I swear it didnâ\\x80\\x99t used to be like this. I used Coinbase and Coinbase wallet before they went public and I kept Bitcoin and a few others in my coinbase wallet. I could move them in and out without any issues. Never had the problems people seem to be dealing with now. I thought that the bigger CB got, the better they would be about taking care of their customers. Especially the ones like me whoâ\\x80\\x99ve been with them well before all of the other exchanges became billion dollar corporations. But it honestly seems like the bigger theyâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten, the less theyâ\\x80\\x99ve done to protect their customers, and I honestly think itâ\\x80\\x99s sad. I do still use coinbase, but sparingly, and even then there are issues there, too. Their customer service seems to be non existent or too overwhelmed to truly be able to help. Either way, I have to absolutely recommend that you donâ\\x80\\x99t use their wallet unless you want your money taken and then ultimately stuck in their wallet with literally no options on how to exchange it or move it without dumping more of your own personal money into it just to get it out. Sorry Coinbase. I hate to leave a bad review. I never review anything, but this warranted a bad review in my humble opinion. Ill change my review if I notice a fix that lets me move my coin out, but itâ\\x80\\x99s such a small amount now that I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even blame you for not concerning yourself with it. Please just read my review if nothing else and recognize the problems with regard to the miner fees and the potential theft in your Dex browser.', \"When searching for the best cryptocurrency wallet to keep your cryptocurrencies, one very important thing that comes to the mind is quality and flexibility of the app due to the variety of options that could be explored in cryptocurrency trading and investment.

I have found 3 problems with this app: 1) Fees are MUCH too high. 2) Failed transactions still charge said high fees. 3) Customer service, while prompt, was useless. Explanations: 1) I have used many crypto wallets and I tried this one because they are a big name in the business. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that the miner fees they charge are very high in comparison to other wallets. Coinbase says that they are not in charge of the miner fees (and receive nothing), but I have found out through several tests (nearly simultaneous) that the fee for the exact same transaction is much lower on other wallets. I am not a crypto engineer so I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why. I am just stating my research. 2) When I tried to earn interest on the app, I sent my SUSD to AAVE V1 THREE times and all three failed with an â\\x80\\x9cout of gasâ\\x80\\x9d error on the blockchain. I did not lose my SUSD but I did lose over $350 in miner fees. I asked for a refund from customer service, but they said no because Coinbase doesnâ\\x80\\x99t receive those fees. 3) I went back and forth with customer service several times over the failed transaction issue. At first, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t answer my questions until I used the email I registered on my regular Coinbase exchange account. That is strange because they say on their website that a Coinbase account is not necessary to use Coinbase Wallet. I have a Coinbase account, so I was eventually ok, but what if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t? Would they refuse to answer questions????? When they finally answered my questions, the answer was useless. They only said that my fees couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be refunded and directed me to a FAQ link which was wholly unhelpful for my issue. I specifically asked them WHY my transactions failed and how I could prevent that from happening again. They havenâ\\x80\\x99t responded since that email (they *were* answering daily), so my guess is they have no fix for the issue. That seems plausible because there is no way to change the gas limit on a trx to lend money to earn interest (note that I had enough ETH in my wallet to pay the miner fees). I am certainly not saying to avoid this app, but all potential users should be aware of these serious issues and choose wisely. Happy HODLing!\\n\\nUpdate 15Janâ\\x80\\x9922:  Customer service responded to my review but they still refuse to (or are unable to) answer the question which I have repeatedly asked:  WHY did my three transactions fail and how can I make sure that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t happen again so I donâ\\x80\\x99t get charged outrageous miner fees for nothing?

I primarily use Trust wallet, Coinbase wallet, and Binance wallet because of the ease of use and simplicity.  I don't need to be trained on how to use each of those wallets because their interface is so simply designed anyone can figure it out on their own.   Metamask is the absolute opposite and looks more like a webpage on my computer crammed into an app rather than a well designed app.  Please update Metamask and make it more user friendly like Trust Wallet.  The browser function on Trust wallet with Dapps is so much more well designed.  It is hard to even use or navigate on Metamask and the app is very clunky and not fluid.

I even loaned from 3 lenders. By the time I withdraw all my funds, the customer service from trust wallet told me I have pay a direct deposit of $30k or they will freeze my fund. I asked them to just deduct from my account. They refused it. I even made a negotiation to them to just pay $10k for the direct deposit instead and withdraw $50k.

Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all well and good because most transactions only cost an equivalent to 25 cents of BNB more or less... but the app only lets you buy BNB in a minimum of $50 increments. If youâ\\x80\\x99re only a few points of a percentage short in BNB, but one of your other currencies is tanking and you want to get out from underneath it, you still need to drop $50 just to get the couple of cents worth of BNB that you need. You canâ\\x80\\x99t even trade other currencies for BNB within the app if you are a few cents short, to make up the difference. \\n\\nThe only other option is to buy BNB in a smaller quantity directly from Binance and then transfer it into your Trust Wallet... But that process involves a a four-day hold on Binanceâ\\x80\\x99s end. By the time your four days are up, the currency you are trying to trade might have tanked entirely.\\n\\nThis app would be much better if you could trade other currencies for BNB within the app, and it back-ended the BNB cost on the transfer.', 'I have several wallets and this one has to be the worse one.

They send you an automated message saying to send in the same things that you did in the first email. Guess what they will get back with you in 2 to 3 days.

I actually was concerned and gave it a test. I transferred a few XRP out to see how complicated it was and it was easy.

I buy my coins on there and transfer to this app. If you have a lot of coins, get a hardware wallet like ledger to put larger amounts. This wallet is good for accounts under 20k, think of the wallet like a checking out.\\n\\nEither way, so far, no problems. Make sure when making transactions you are using the correct things.

Do test before depositing larger amounts of money to ensure youâ\\x80\\x99re doing everything correctly. \\n\\nLastly, keep your codes safe. I have mine in a safe.

Trust Wallet support has been nothing but automated messages with zero support at all. I can not get the transaction data to see where my funds went. This is straight up theft so please extreme caution with this wallet.

If the wrong recovery phrase is utilized it will let you know the phrase is incorrect and will not open anything. I have all my transaction records, as well as my wallet recovery key and wallet address written down together but now the wallet address does not match the recovery key.

So I have not fully figured it out yet.  \\n\\nAlso, your first (test) purchased can be slow and sometimes the fees are high (say $8 USD on a $150 USD purchase).  Generally, the fees are less.

I suggest familiarizing yourself with the wallet and the exchange before you add funds to either. Review your recovery phrase and save it to the cloud, write it down, or commit it to memory.

I have not experienced this ever before using other internet-based wallets and hardware wallets.  Normally when I submit a transfer on the Ethereum network it goes.  This is the first time I have had a transfer fail multiple times and take Ethereum gas fees every time.

That means if you us a coin other than ETH then you have to convert part of it to ETH to even get your money out even if the coin is part of the Ethereum network.

Signing up and going through identification and vetting process is easy and quick. Coinbase has rewards for watching videos and taking quizzes.

I have found 3 problems with this app: 1) Fees are MUCH too high. 2) Failed transactions still charge said high fees. 3) Customer service, while prompt, was useless. Explanations: 1) I have used many crypto wallets and I tried this one because they are a big name in the business. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that the miner fees they charge are very high in comparison to other wallets. Coinbase says that they are not in charge of the miner fees (and receive nothing), but I have found out through several tests (nearly simultaneous) that the fee for the exact same transaction is much lower on other wallets. I am not a crypto engineer so I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why. I am just stating my research. 2) When I tried to earn interest on the app, I sent my SUSD to AAVE V1 THREE times and all three failed with an â\\x80\\x9cout of gasâ\\x80\\x9d error on the blockchain. I did not lose my SUSD but I did lose over $350 in miner fees. I asked for a refund from customer service, but they said no because Coinbase doesnâ\\x80\\x99t receive those fees. 3) I went back and forth with customer service several times over the failed transaction issue. At first, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t answer my questions until I used the email I registered on my regular Coinbase exchange account. That is strange because they say on their website that a Coinbase account is not necessary to use Coinbase Wallet. I have a Coinbase account, so I was eventually ok, but what if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t? Would they refuse to answer questions????? When they finally answered my questions, the answer was useless. They only said that my fees couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be refunded and directed me to a FAQ link which was wholly unhelpful for my issue. I specifically asked them WHY my transactions failed and how I could prevent that from happening again. They havenâ\\x80\\x99t responded since that email (they *were* answering daily), so my guess is they have no fix for the issue. That seems plausible because there is no way to change the gas limit on a trx to lend money to earn interest (note that I had enough ETH in my wallet to pay the miner fees). I am certainly not saying to avoid this app, but all potential users should be aware of these serious issues and choose wisely. Happy HODLing!\\n\\nUpdate 15Janâ\\x80\\x9922:  Customer service responded to my review but they still refuse to (or are unable to) answer the question which I have repeatedly asked:  WHY did my three transactions fail and how can I make sure that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t happen again so I donâ\\x80\\x99t get charged outrageous miner fees for nothing?

I really did. I have given it every opportunity to be useful, but it just doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work for me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had two different coins in my wallet for months now. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried converting them, exchanging them, staking them, and even just moving them from the wallet to Coinbase exchange. I can do none of the options I just mentioned. Moving coin from Coinbase to the wallet was as simple as you can imagine. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t even cost me a fee. That is absolutely not the way it works going the other direction. Try to move coin into coinbase exchange and youâ\\x80\\x99ll get the same exact thing you get trying to stake it or convert it. The miner fees are too high and you simply canâ\\x80\\x99t afford it. So, it just sits there. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s worse is, I tried to use their Dex browser to exchange, the exchange they recommended (matcha or something) took my ETH as a fee like it was going to exchange my coin, then literally did not make the exchange and told me I needed to deposit more ETH if I wanted to make a swap. Ultimately the exchange took at least $100 of ETH from me as a fee without even swapping. Somehow it ended up leaving me literally with $2 worth of ETH and $8 worth of LEASH. I know for a fact I had $150 worth of ETH and $100 worth of LEASH. Now, the balances are so low I canâ\\x80\\x99t do anything with the weak amounts that are left in the wallet. The wallet doesnâ\\x80\\x99t support LEASH and the ETH isnâ\\x80\\x99t enough to cover even the most minute transaction. All it does is ask me to deposit more ETH while also disclosing that they are not responsible for miner fees. I swear it didnâ\\x80\\x99t used to be like this. I used Coinbase and Coinbase wallet before they went public and I kept Bitcoin and a few others in my coinbase wallet. I could move them in and out without any issues. Never had the problems people seem to be dealing with now. I thought that the bigger CB got, the better they would be about taking care of their customers. Especially the ones like me whoâ\\x80\\x99ve been with them well before all of the other exchanges became billion dollar corporations. But it honestly seems like the bigger theyâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten, the less theyâ\\x80\\x99ve done to protect their customers, and I honestly think itâ\\x80\\x99s sad. I do still use coinbase, but sparingly, and even then there are issues there, too. Their customer service seems to be non existent or too overwhelmed to truly be able to help. Either way, I have to absolutely recommend that you donâ\\x80\\x99t use their wallet unless you want your money taken and then ultimately stuck in their wallet with literally no options on how to exchange it or move it without dumping more of your own personal money into it just to get it out. Sorry Coinbase. I hate to leave a bad review. I never review anything, but this warranted a bad review in my humble opinion. Ill change my review if I notice a fix that lets me move my coin out, but itâ\\x80\\x99s such a small amount now that I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even blame you for not concerning yourself with it.
